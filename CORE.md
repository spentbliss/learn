- Memory management: malloc/free, stack vs heap, structs  
- File I/O, function pointers, modular code (headers)  
- Debugging with gdb, memory checking with valgrind, Makefiles  

### Projects
- Number guessing game  
- CLI to-do list app with file persistence  
- Simple logger with callback functions  

### Resources
- *K&R The C Programming Language*  
- Supplement: *Learn C the Hard Way* exercises  

---

## Module 2: Data Structures & Algorithms (4 weeks)

### Topics
- Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hashing  
- Trees: BST, heaps, tries  
- Graphs: adjacency list/matrix, BFS, DFS  
- Sorting: quicksort, mergesort, heapsort  
- Algorithm analysis basics: Big-O notation  

### Projects
- Implement core data structures in C  
- Pathfinding using BFS/DFS  
- Visualize sorting algorithms via terminal  

### Resources
- *The Algorithm Design Manual* by Skiena — Ch 3–7  
- Big-O Notation [Big-O Notation](https://youtu.be/Mo4vesaut8g?si=Aw_5SA_3vrdW5nEB)
- Practice on LeetCode (focus on easy/medium)  

---

## Module 3: Computer Architecture (2 weeks)

### Topics
- Number systems, data representation (binary, hex, two’s complement)  
- CPU architecture basics, registers, instruction set intro  
- Memory hierarchy: cache, RAM, virtual memory  
- Linking and loading process  

### Projects
- Binary/hex converter CLI tool  
- Analyze assembly generated by simple C programs  

### Resources
- *Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective* — Select Chapters 1,2,3,6,7,9  

---

## Module 4: Operating Systems (3 weeks)

### Topics
- Processes, threads, concurrency basics  
- Synchronization primitives: mutexes, semaphores  
- Memory management concepts: paging, segmentation  
- Filesystems basics, system calls  

### Projects
- Simple shell with process management  
- Thread pool implementation with synchronization  
- Basic malloc implementation  

### Resources
- *Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces* — Process, Threads, Synchronization, VM, 
  Filesystem chapters  

---

## Module 5: Networking (2 weeks)

### Topics
- TCP/IP stack overview, HTTP, DNS basics  
- Socket programming in C (BSD sockets)  
- Routing, congestion control basics  

### Projects
- TCP client-server chat application  
- Simple HTTP server  

### Resources
- *Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach* — Ch 1–6  

---

## Module 6: Capstone Project & Review (1 week)

- Build a multi-component project (e.g., multi-threaded HTTP proxy, networked chat 
  with file I/O)  
- Review and solidify weak areas  
- Document and reflect on learnings  

---

# Tips

- Study ~6 hours daily divided as: 2 hrs reading/concepts, 3 hrs coding/projects,  
  1 hr review/reflection  
- Build projects alongside theory for applied learning  
- Use debugging and profiling tools early and often  
- Solve problems on LeetCode or HackerRank focused on modules learned
